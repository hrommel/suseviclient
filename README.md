SUSE VI Client
==============

Lightweight tool for ESXi management from Linux box.


Features
--------

* VM creation and provisioning from

	* ISO 
	* VMDK
	* SUSE Studio
	* PXE 

* Cloning

* Snapshotting

* Virtual network management

* VM control through VNC

* Exporting to VMware Workstation/Player

* Nested virtualization enablement

How does it work?
-----------------

It wraps and automates so called ESXi 'Tech Support Mode' which is
effectively ssh server and number of special(poor documented) VMware
management commands.

Currently it well tested with ESXi 4.0/4.1. It should also work with
ESX, but it was minimally covered by testing.

Recent ESXi 5.0 support is also tested and implemented.

Examples
--------

		cat > ~/.suseviclientrc << EOF
		esx_server="esxi.example.com"
		studioserver="susestudio.com"
		apiuser="your_user"
		apikey="your_key"
		EOF

1) Create VM of 512MB RAM and 8GB disk with ISO attached, poweron,
   connect to VM console:

		suseviclient.sh -c -n "ISO Example" -m 512 -d 8G \
      --iso datastore1/path/to/image.iso
		Enter new VNC password:
		Repeat VNC password:

* List existing VMs

		suseviclient.sh -l

		Powerstate      VMID    VM Label                                Config file
		----------      ----    --------                                -----------
		Powered on       16     SLES4VMware 32bit      [datastore1] SLES4VMware 32bit/SLES4VMware 32bit.vmx
		Powered on       32     SLES4VMware 64bit      [datastore1] SLES4VMware 64bit/SLES4VMware 64bit.vmx
		Powered off      64     ISO Example            [datastore1] ISO Example/ISO Example.vmx

* Power on VM

		suseviclient.sh --poweron 64

Where 64 is VM id.

* Connect to VM console

		suseviclient.sh --vnc 64

2) Create VM from VMDK image( includes automated conversion of desktop
   vmdk to server version):

		suseviclient.sh -c -n "VMDK Example" --vmdk datastore1/path/to/image.vmdk

3) Create VM from SUSE Studio appliance

		suseviclient.sh -c -n "Appliance Deployment" --studio $appliance_id

4) Create VM from PXE 

		suseviclient.sh -c -n "PXE Example" -m 512 -d 5G

This will create blank VM with network attached. If PXE is enabled in
your network it should be possible to perform a network boot after the
VM is powered on.

5) Create VM with nested virtualization capabilities, a.k.a. to test
   another hypervisor within ESXi( KVM works pretty good there!)
   
    suseviclient.sh -c -n "Nested VM Example" \
      --vmdk datastore1/path/to/image.vmdk --nested
    
--vmdk provided only for illustration: --nested will work with any
provisioning type.

For full list of possible options see
 
		suseviclient.sh --help

Installation
------------

Just download and put suseviclient.sh somewhere in the $PATH
for your convenience.

Shell version of suseviclient introduces no dependencies except of bash,
ssh and vncviewer which can be found on almost any Linux desktop.


On the ESXi server side you have to enable ssh access, see: 

* http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1003677 for ESXi 4.0
* http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1017910 for ESXi 4.1/5.0

It's recommended to upload your ssh key to the server to not to enter
password each time as passing management command through client.
The root fs on ESXi is not permanent storage, so it's recommended to put
the key on some connected datastore and automate the key copy on next
reboot.

Assuming that you have "datastore1" connected to ESXi server, do this

		mkdir /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/.ssh/ and place your ssh key there

		echo "cp -r /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/.ssh/ /" >> /etc/rc.local

That's it. It's all you need to start using suseviclient.

All .rb files are additional modules (like web interface) and will be
described separately.

Web Interface
-------------

Web fronted is available with webfrontend.rb currently under initial
development state but already functional.

It is built with 

* Sinatra (http://www.sinatrarb.com/) ruby framework (so please
  '# gem install sinatra' if you want to try)

* NoVNC (VNC client using HTML5 WebSockets, Canvas,
  http://kanaka.github.com/noVNC/) to allow access to VMs consoles.
